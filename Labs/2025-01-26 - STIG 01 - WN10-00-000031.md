# Step 1: Create VM
Created a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure.
No Public IP (Private IP only)
Connected with Bastion on Azure

# Step 2: Turn Off Firewall
Turned off Windows Firewall (for easier scanning)

# Step 3: Tenable Scan
### A) Create New Scan
Took note of Private IP and created a new "Advanced Network Scan" in Nessus Tenable:
STIG-Implementation-01-DJH
Scanner: LOCAL-SCAN-ENGINE-01
Private IP: 10.0.0.67

![[Screenshot 2025-01-26 at 16.57.55.png]]

### B) Credentials
Provided credentials for Windows 10 VM to Tenable for credentialed scan (most in-depth scan type).

![[Screenshot 2025-01-26 at 17.02.56.png]]


### C) Compliance
Add Compliance Checks for DISA STIGs

![[Screenshot 2025-01-26 at 17.05.29.png]]

Select DISA Windows 10 STIG v3r2 and Save.

### D) Policy Checks Only

Disable all plugins except for "Policy compliance."
* (This is done to limit scan time by reducing scope to just the things listed in the STIG.)

### E) Save & Launch Scan

# Step 4: Review Results of Scan

![[Screenshot 2025-01-26 at 19.29.14.png]]

There are a number of items that failed the audit. 

I select one to remediate:
* WN10-00-000031

# Step 5: Produce PowerShell Script

```
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    This PowerShell script creates or updates a Group Policy Object (GPO) to configure BitLocker settings that require additional authentication at startup, enforcing either a TPM startup PIN or a TPM startup key and PIN, and applies the changes to the local system.

### The Above Script, Explained

1. **GPO Creation or Update**:
    - The script checks if the GPO named "STIG BitLocker Policy" exists. If it doesn't, it creates one.
    
2. **Registry Path for BitLocker Settings**:
    - The relevant registry path is `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`.

3. **Key Configuration Values**:
    - `UseAdvancedStartup = 1`: Enables the "Require additional authentication at startup" policy.
    - `UseTPM = 2`: Configures the TPM for startup.
    - `UsePIN = 1`: Requires a startup PIN with TPM.

4. **Optional Settings**:
    - If you want to configure the startup key and PIN, uncomment the `UseKeyAndPIN` line.

5. **Apply Policy**:
    - The script applies the changes locally with `gpupdate /force`.



I noticed that the script won't work because I haven't set the PIN. I am going to need to do that in order for it to work properly. Otherwise, when I reboot, the machine won't start, because there is no PIN for BitLocker even though it is required.

I updated the script to this:

```PowerShell
# ConfigureBitLockerWithPin.ps1

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    This PowerShell script configures Group Policy settings to enforce BitLocker with TPM and PIN authentication, initializes or updates BitLocker on the specified drive, sets a startup PIN, and verifies the configuration for secure boot.

# Step 6: Deploy PowerShell Script

Attempt to employ PowerShell Script to remediate this vulnerability.

![[Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 01.07.29.png]]

### Verified Successful Deployment

1. Saved the script to a `.ps1` file (e.g., `ConfigureBitLockerPolicy.ps1`).
2. Ran the script in PowerShell with administrative privileges.
3. Verified the applied settings in the Group Policy Editor:
    - Navigated to: `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker Drive Encryption > Operating System Drives`.
    - Confirmed the policy is set to **Enabled** with the required configuration.

# Wait A Minute... This isn't going to work.

This STIG is all about requiring a user to enter a PIN during pre-boot. Well, since this is a Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure, I don't have the opportunity to enter a PIN during pre-boot before I can access the machine. (I rely on RDP over Port 3389 to do that.)

# What I Can Do Instead

Include a **risk acceptance or waiver** for this specific STIG, citing Azure's limitations with requiring a startup PIN.

Example:

### **Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) Compliance Waiver**

#### **STIG ID**: WN10-00-000031

#### **STIG Title**: Require additional authentication at startup for operating system drives.

---

#### **Waiver Request Details**

- **System Name**: [Your Azure VM Name]
- **System Location**: Microsoft Azure
- **System Purpose**: [Briefly describe the purpose of the system, e.g., "Enterprise application server"]
- **System Owner**: [Name and contact information of the system owner]
- **Date of Waiver Submission**: [Insert date]

#### **STIG Requirement**

The STIG requires enabling BitLocker Drive Encryption with additional authentication at startup, configured as:

- "Require startup PIN with TPM" or
- "Require startup key and PIN with TPM."

#### **Operational Limitation**

Azure VMs leverage a virtualized TPM and do not support user interaction during the boot process, which is required for entering a startup PIN or key. Enforcing this configuration would render the system non-bootable, thereby making the system unusable and inaccessible.

#### **Risk Analysis**

By implementing BitLocker with **TPM-only** protection (without a startup PIN), the system ensures disk encryption using a hardware-backed key stored in the virtualized TPM. Although this does not meet the additional authentication requirement, the following controls mitigate risks:

1. **Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)**: The disk is protected and managed via Azure Key Vault for added security.
2. **Access Controls**: The VM is restricted through Azure NSGs (Network Security Groups), requiring role-based access control (RBAC) for remote management.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: The system is integrated with Azure Security Center, providing continuous monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity.
4. **Regular Backups**: Regular snapshots and encrypted backups are maintained to ensure data recovery.

#### **Mitigation Plan**

- Implement **TPM-only protection** to encrypt operating system drives, ensuring secure storage of encryption keys in the virtualized TPM.
- Utilize **Azure Key Vault** to store and manage recovery keys securely.
- Maintain system security through continuous patching, regular vulnerability scans, and rigorous access controls.
- Periodically review Azure platform features to identify advancements that may support full compliance with this STIG.

#### **Waiver Approval**

**Submitted by**:

- Name: [System Owner or Administrator]
- Title: [Job Title]
- Date: [Insert date]

**Approved by**:

- Name: [Authorizing Official]
- Title: [Job Title]
- Date: [Insert date]

#### **Review Cycle**

This waiver will be reviewed annually or upon any changes to Azure capabilities that enable compliance with the STIG.

# This STIG Implementation is Abandoned
